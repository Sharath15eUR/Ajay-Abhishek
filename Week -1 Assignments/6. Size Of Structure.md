CODE:
#include <stdio.h>
typedef struct
{
    int A;
    char B;
    char C;
} InfoData;
int main(int argc, char*argv[])
{
    printf("\n Size of Structure = %d \n\n",sizeof(InfoData));
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
 Size of Structure = 8 

 EXPLANATION:
 In the given code, the size of the structure InfoData would be determined by the sum of the sizes of the individual members would be 4(member 'A' int type) + 1(member 'B' char type) + 1(member 'C' is char type) = 6 bytes. However, due to alignment requirements, most compilers will add padding to the structure to ensure that each member is properly aligned in memory. Hence the size of the InfoData structure would be 8 bytes, due to padding added by the compiler to meet alignment requirements.
