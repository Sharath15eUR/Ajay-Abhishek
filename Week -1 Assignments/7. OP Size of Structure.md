CODE:
#include <stdio.h>
typedef struct
{
    char A;
    double B;
    char C;
} InfoData;
int main(int argc, char*argv[])
{
    printf("\n Size of Structure = %d \n\n",sizeof(InfoData));
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
 Size of Structure = 16

 EXPLANATION:
The size of the InfoData structure would be 16 bytes, with padding added by the compiler to meet alignment requirements for the double B member where there would likely be padding added after the char A member and before the char C member to align the double B member properly. .
